The Event
---------
Each day a challenge will be given.  In a branch corresponding to the year I will post my solution to the challenge 
All of the prompts will be in a directory called `prompts`, and each solution will be in a directory called 
`solutions` with the file name being the day of the challenge (`day01.py1`, `day02.py`, etc.).
